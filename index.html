            <h1>What is Elon’s Bucks?</h1>
            <p class = "main">The Elons Bucks are 100x100 pixel art images, generated algorithmically. Most of them are associated with Elon Musk’s Tesla and SpaceX. All images have their own number and tire (common, rare, legendary) and circulation, as well as their ownership/for-sale status. Each token contains information about the time of the snapshot, as well as Tesla and Spacex stocks price at the time of publication</p>
            <p class = "main">What exactly is going on here?
                    CryptoCoins were made famous by Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is designed just to transact and store ownership of Bitcoin itself. We are using a successor to Bitcoin called Binance Smart Chain which allows for arbitrary computer code to be executed on the blockchain and the results of the execution to be stored forever. This is pretty cool! Normally code is run on a server somewhere and you basically need to trust the person running the server. Binance Smart Chain lets everyone execute the code, show each other what result they got, and agree that the code was executed properly and fairly.</p>

            <h1>Where can i buy Elon’s NFT? On OpenSea!</h1>
            <p class = "main">OpenSea is a marketplace for digital goods, including collectibles, gaming items, digital art, and other digital assets that are backed by a blockchain like Binance Smart Chain. On OpenSea, you can buy, sell, and trade any of these items with anyone in the world. OpenSea is currently the largest general marketplace for user-owned digital goods, with the broadest set of categories (200 and growing), the most items (over 4 million), and the best prices for new categories of items.</p>
            <p class = "main">OpenSea is also a decentralized marketplace. Trading on on OpenSea happens through a smart contract, meaning that no central authority ever holds custody of your items. Instead, users store items in their wallet of choice - whether that's a mobile wallet like Coinbase Walletor Opera Touch or an in-browser chrome extension like MetaMask. To better understand the inner workings of the OpenSea marketplace, you can check out the open source code for the OpenSea smart contracts.</p>

            <h1>Buying procedure</h1>
            <div class = "main">
                <p>Once we will complete our presale and release on OpenSea platform, you will be able to buy Elon’s NFT on it for ElonsBucks tokens.
                    1)Download and install a Chrome browser plugin called MetaMask. This will allow websites (that you authorize) access to your Binance Smart Chain account.
                    2)If you made a new account, buy some BNB. The MetaMask plugin has a button that will allow you to buy BNB from Binance.
                    3)Once you have the plugin installed, this website will recognize it and add buttons that allow you to bid on, buy and sell Elon’s NFT for ElonsBucksTokens directly in the interface.
                    4)For example, you can buy TeslaTruckCrush#10 for 5 BNB (~$1000 USD)</p>

            <h1>Elon’s Bucks - community driven token</h1>
            <p class = "main">We have written code that lives on the blockchain that anyone can use to buy and sell ElonBuck’s with anyone else in the world. An interesting aspect of this system is that we no longer have any control over the code running ElonBuck’s! Once we released it onto the blockchain it became permanently embedded there and can no longer be modified by anyone. This is scary for us as developers because we worry about bugs, but it is also a very powerful feature of the system. It allows a user verify that there are indeed only 10,000 Elon’s NFT tokens, check that we can't steal them from you, and basically make sure that everything we told you about the code is true.</p>
